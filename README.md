# HAULAH MUSA AND SHAKIRAH HAWEZI BOOK PROJECT.

In this project, we have created a Book Management System App that will enable users to manage their books with ease. It supports all the core CRUD operationsâ€”Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It also goes beyond and it includes features for searching, filtering, and marking favorite books thus offering a fully customizable library experience.
